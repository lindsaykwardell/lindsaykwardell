### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Lindsay

#### I'm a software developer and IT professional

I am a programmer, writer, and mother. I work as a Senior Software Engineer at NoRedInk. I am experienced in building web applications with modern frontend frameworks, such as Vue, React, and Svelte, as well as backend technologies including Node, Sprint Boot, and SQL. I also enjoy blogging and presenting online about the technologies that I love working with. 

I am currently learning more about functional programming, and utilizing languages like Elm and Haskell for side projects and at work.
