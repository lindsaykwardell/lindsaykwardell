I'd like to maybe grow up sometime. I wanted to be a teacher most of all when I was a kid and I got my degreee in education. Graduated into a recession so never worked professionally as a teacher, but I have taught almost every day of my life in some form or other so I think I fulfilled my ambition. Good post!
