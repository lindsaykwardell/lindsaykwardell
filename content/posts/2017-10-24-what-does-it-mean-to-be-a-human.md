_This post is the first in a series about the history of Ilandrior and its various races. This will be told as close as possible as it would be by the people it talks about. Not everything is covered here, but I think it’s a good starting point._

* * *

**To be a human is to belong to the chosen people.** The earliest recorded civilization belonged to the humans, and covered nearly the entire western portion of the continent. Its name was Ilandrior, named after its first king, Ilandin. According to legend, Ilandin was chosen by the gods of creation to rule humankind, and the World itself. The capital of this vast empire was named Althênor, located on the shore of the Ilandrian Sea. This city was claimed to be built by the gods of creation as a place of safety in their wars with the lesser gods, but in time came to be a bastion for the armies of Ilandrior.

**To be a human is to be an enemy of all other races.** This did not sit well with other races, in particular the dragons. Solvadon, the Golden, emperor of the Northern lands, determined that Ilandrior could not be allowed to remain. With his two generals Karr and Aior, the united armies of the dragons, centaur, satyr, and minotaur managed to overthrow Ilandrior, raze Althênor, and scatter the remnants of humanity across the continent. For generations, humanity was scourged and enslaved by all other powers, hated for the arrogance to believe that the gods had chosen them. In time, only smalls fragment of ancient Ilandrior remained, isolated in regions where the greater powers did not seek dominion. In these places, the legends that form the foundation of humanity were codified.

**To be a human is to reclaim past glory.** Ilthanen Juralen, of the kingdom of Ilandri, took an army of humans from the city of Cartoth back to the ancient ruins of Althênor. Now the home of lesser dragons and their slaves, Ilthanen led a campaign against the ruin’s masters, eventually slaying them and casting their remains into the sea. Now liberated, the city, called Alden by its new keepers, was turned into a fortress for humanity. From Alden, humanity would reclaim the center of its former empire, now called the Juralen Valley. This new empire would continue to expand humanity’s new civilization, touching the Halsladian highlands, Seralian plains, Bê Haral foothills, and beyond. Humanity’s eyes remained fixed on the legends of the past, and sought to rebuild the World as it once had been.

**To be a human is to fight.** As humanity spread abroad, along with its determination for conquest, divisions between its generals were inevitable. The Juralen Empire fractured, leading to a multitude of wars between diverse factions. Whenever forces threatened the whole, however, these kingdoms would unite in common cause.

**To be a human is to adapt.** While these events took place in the Juralen valley, other human nations were born across the continent. Wherever they were, whatever their circumstances, humans were able to adapt to their situation and thrive. In the valleys of the dwarves, the city of Castlehead was established as a center of commerce between dwarves, orcs, elves, and even giants. In the elven lands, humanity came to blend in with the forests, building their cities to be in tune with nature.

**To be a human is to be diverse.** As humanity scattered across the World, and adapted to its circumstances, each region became more and more distinct from the others. Soon, the term ‘human’ was not enough to describe any one people. Cultural terms, such as ‘Halsladian’, ‘Juralen’, ‘Seralian’, and others became more important than race.

We will explore each of these peoples separately at a later time, but the above apply to all humanity. We will also go into each of the races in turn, but as The Folly of Wizards focuses primarily on humanity, I wanted to start with them. Also, I assume that most of my readers would relate more to humanity than the other races.
