What do you call a song not sung?

What do you call the breeze not felt? <br />
The rain that never fell? <br />
The ocean waves that never crashed against a lonely beach? <br />

What do you call that which has never come to pass, <br />
Or never can? <br />
What do you call that which cannot be named <br />
Because it never was? <br />

Swirling and circling around us, day by day, <br />
Worlds without end vanish and decay <br />
Like a drop of water in the sea. <br />

Did they know they even existed? <br />
That they mattered? <br />
When the future dies, does it know? <br />
Or is its passing soft and silent, <br />
Shrouded and forgotten to even itself? <br />

What do you call a joy not felt? <br />
A tear not shed? <br />
A moment never shared? <br />

What do you call these things?
