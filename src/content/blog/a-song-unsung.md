What do you call a song not sung?

What do you call the breeze not felt? \
The rain that never fell? \
The ocean waves that never crashed against a lonely beach?

What do you call that which has never come to pass, \
Or never can? \
What do you call that which cannot be named \
Because it never was?

Swirling and circling around us, day by day, \
Worlds without end vanish and decay \
Like a drop of water in the sea.

Did they know they even existed? \
That they mattered? \
When the future dies, does it know? \
Or is its passing soft and silent, \
Shrouded and forgotten to even itself?

What do you call a joy not felt? \
A tear not shed? \
A moment never shared?

What do you call these things?
