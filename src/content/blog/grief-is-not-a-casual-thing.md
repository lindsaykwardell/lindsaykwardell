Grief is not a casual thing.

It's not something you pick up as a hobby,<br />
or go to watch at the movies.

It's not a snack, or a treat,<br />
or a get-rich-quick scheme.

It's not a mural on a building<br />
or a meme shared by a friend.

It's not even a poem<br />
written in a moment of clarity.

No.

Grief is more than that.

Grief is a way of life,<br />
a modality of viewing the world around you.

Grief is the ocean, filling the horizon<br />
in all directions until you can't see the land.

Grief is the sky, filled with dazzling stars,<br />
pinpricks of pain and sorrow on an empty canvas.

When approaching grief,<br />
do not think yourself in control.<br />
Allow the grief to come over you,<br />
fill you,<br />
pierce your soul<br />
without backing down<br />
or looking away.

Drink it in,<br />
and feel<br />
what<br />
remains<br />
in<br />
its<br />
wake.

Keep watching it, closely,<br />
without guilt or shame,<br />
as tears well<br />
and the colors of the world<br />
dim around you.

They won't dim forever.

But this is important.

A casual grief can bear much,

But a transformative grief,<br />
that pain is powerful enough<br />
to heal a life.
