Grief is not a casual thing.

It's not something you pick up as a hobby,\
or go to watch at the movies.

It's not a snack, or a treat,\
or a get-rich-quick scheme.

It's not a mural on a building\
or a meme shared by a friend.

It's not even a poem\
written in a moment of clarity.

No.

Grief is more than that.

Grief is a way of life,\
a modality of viewing the world around you.

Grief is the ocean, filling the horizon\
in all directions until you can't see the land.

Grief is the sky, filled with dazzling stars,\
pinpricks of pain and sorrow on an empty canvas.

When approaching grief,\
do not think yourself in control.\
Allow the grief to come over you,\
fill you,\
pierce your soul\
without backing down\
or looking away.

Drink it in,\
and feel\
what\
remains\
in\
its\
wake.

Keep watching it, closely,\
without guilt or shame,\
as tears well\
and the colors of the world\
dim around you.

They won't dim forever.

But this is important.

A casual grief can bear much,

But a transformative grief,\
that pain is powerful enough\
to heal a life.
