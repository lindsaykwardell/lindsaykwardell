I have no words.

I see reports of immigrants taken\
from homes, from jobs, from hospital,\
and I have no words.

I read orders erasing my identity,\
wiping my rights away one by one,\
and I have no words.

I watch headlines of raised tarriffs,\
fired officials,\
leaked personal information,\
crashing planes,\
and I have no words.

I hear the cries\
of people fearing,\
crying,\
hurting,\
dying,\
and I have no words.

There are no words\
for atrocities such as this.\
They all fall flat,\
too hollow,\
too frail.

And so I watch, read, listen, and mourn,\
wordless in the torrent,\
hoping it passes swiftly,\
fearing it may not pass at all.

I have no words\
for the cruelty with which\
we now live.
