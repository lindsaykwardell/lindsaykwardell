snippet: Once, the dream died. But only once.
---
Once, I dreamt of stars blazing,<br />
Sunrise burning,<br />
Horizons beckoning.

Once, I dreamt of wild forests,<br />
Soaring mountains,<br />
Flowing rivers.

Once, the dream died.<br />
No more stars.<br />
No more forests.

Once, the dream became an echo,<br />
The echo a memory,<br />
The memory forgotten.

Once, the dream died.

But only once.

Now, the stars’ flame is renewed,<br />
The trees whisper once more,<br />
Horizons call out, “Come back.”

And this time,<br />
I will listen.
