Once, I dreamt of stars blazing,\
Sunrise burning,\
Horizons beckoning.

Once, I dreamt of wild forests,\
Soaring mountains,\
Flowing rivers.

Once, the dream died.\
No more stars.\
No more forests.

Once, the dream became an echo,\
The echo a memory,\
The memory forgotten.

Once, the dream died.

But only once.

Now, the stars’ flame is renewed,\
The trees whisper once more,\
Horizons call out, “Come back.”

And this time,\
I will listen.
