I hold up my life to the light<br />
and observe the shapes drawn across it.

Swirls of delight, bright dashes of joy,<br />
Long, gentle moments with friends.<br />
The light shimmers joyously here.

Strokes of bitterness, anger,<br />
Where the colors are dull and uneven.<br />
Blotches mark where patches were placed.

There are cracks in it, too; I touch them gently.<br />
Moments when all seemed lost,<br />
But not forever.<br />
Not now.

Some parts have snapped off completely,<br />
Whether by my hand or another’s;<br />
Here the colors are vibrant,<br />
The memories most sharp, the light most attuned.

It is not a pretty thing, all bulky and misshapen.<br />
It won’t win any contests, and it’s too big for a shelf.<br />
I don’t suppose someone would pay for it<br />
And show it to their friends.

And yet, it’s beauty is undeniable.<br />
The light etches across it like the embrace of time,<br />
Full of nostalgia and promise at once.<br />
It’s taken a lifetime to make,<br />
And I think I see some room left for more changes.

I set my life on the table before me.<br />
It rests there, all crooked and wobbly.<br />
I feel every moment I poured it.<br />
Every tear.<br />
Every laugh.<br />
Every sigh.<br />
Every word.<br />
I feel them all, breathing them in.

I embrace the creation before me.<br />
Its sharp edges prick my arms,<br />
But I don’t back away.<br />
They deserve love, too.

I breathe, and the smells of moments long past fill me.<br />
I listen, and songs dance in my soul.<br />
I feel, and I feel it all.

I release, and before me <br />
The poor thing I made is beautiful, <br />
Filled with wonder and sorrow,<br />
Yearning and mourning.

Its beauty is unique, unlike any other.<br />
Some may not see it,<br />
But I do.<br />
And I will treasure it always.
