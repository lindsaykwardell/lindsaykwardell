snippet: For now, I stand between hope, between joy, between lives.
type: Poetry

When I look to my past, \
I see golden times \
with those I loved \
and who loved me.

I hear the sounds of laughter,  \
feel the gentle touch on my face, \
smell the scents of nature \
as they spread into the open air.

When I look to the future, \
I see golden horizons, \
star-filled skies \
with the moon high above.

I hear the call of adventure, \
of unknown places, \
of new faces and new friends \
reaching out in a chorus of wonder.

For now, \
I stand between hope, \
between joy, \
between lives.

I stand, and allow myself to stand, \
feel what I am feeling, \
allow the chapter to end \
so another can begin.

I stand at the edge of the new, \
the twilight of the old, \
the start of an adventure \
and the end of a journey.

Yesterday can rest.

Tomorrow can wait.

Today, \
I will mourn.
