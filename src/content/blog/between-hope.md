When I look to my past, <br />
I see golden times <br />
with those I loved <br/>
and who loved me.

I hear the sounds of laughter,  <br />
feel the gentle touch on my face, <br />
smell the scents of nature <br />
as they spread into the open air.

When I look to the future, <br />
I see golden horizons, <br />
star-filled skies <br />
with the moon high above.

I hear the call of adventure, <br />
of unknown places, <br />
of new faces and new friends <br />
reaching out in a chorus of wonder.

For now, <br />
I stand between hope, <br />
between joy, <br />
between lives.

I stand, and allow myself to stand, <br />
feel what I am feeling, <br />
allow the chapter to end <br />
so another can begin.

I stand at the edge of the new, <br />
the twilight of the old, <br />
the start of an adventure <br />
and the end of a journey.

Yesterday can rest.

Tomorrow can wait.

Today, <br />
I will mourn.
