Once, in a dream,<br />
I stood before my younger self.<br />
She looked up at me,<br />
unrecognizing,<br />
curious,<br />
wondering.<br />

I looked down at her,<br />
and saw her fears,<br />
her worries,<br />
her questions.<br />

What could I say to her?<br />
What could I tell her<br />
of the life she would lead,<br />
of the people she would know?<br />

That within a year,<br />
an entire school would mock her,<br />
and she would feel alone<br />
among her peers?<br />

In a handful more,<br />
she would find friendships,<br />
all while hiding <br />
who she truly was?<br />

"Don't do that,"<br />
her mom would say,<br />
"they'll call you a girl."<br />

Pretending to wear a skirt<br />
while getting dressed<br />
so nobody would know?<br />

Walking the halls of high school,<br />
noticing the other girls,<br />
and wishing only <br />
to be one of them?<br />

What could I say to her<br />
that would even make sense?<br />
Her body changing in all the wrong ways,<br />
living mostly in her mind?<br />

And then whisked away<br />
to unknown lands,<br />
called to serve at the whims<br />
of men who didn't know her.<br />

"Don't do that,"<br />
they would say,<br />
"focus on your mission."<br />

While all she did<br />
was write her feelings<br />
as if they were fiction.<br />

Trying desperately to help,<br />
sharing a message of love,<br />
using flawed tools<br />
to help flawed people.<br />

Standing by when another said,<br />
"You know being gay's a sin, right?"<br />
And the three men nodded<br />
their heads in shame.<br />

Standing by when young men<br />
abused authority over others<br />
to shout, belittle, and burn,<br />
all in the service of heaven.<br />

Standing by, as a witness,<br />
when a woman was hit by a car,<br />
because she had been told<br />
not to get involved.<br />

What could I say to her then,<br />
wearing a suit and tie,<br />
nametag emblazoned on her pocket,<br />
that could truly ease her guilt?<br />

But soon enough she would<br />
return home, only to begin again.<br />
Home wasn't the same any more;<br />
how could anything be?<br />

A whirlwind of activity would follow.<br />
Marriage, job, child to love.<br />
Friendships and hobbies cast aside<br />
to serve this new family.<br />

And then, the Discovery.<br />
Writing a note to her wife,<br />
"I think I'm trans,<br />
I'm really scared."<br />

Who was she?<br />
What truly was the world?<br />
Faith and understanding gone<br />
in the blink of an eye.<br />

What could I say to help<br />
in that moment of utter darkness?<br />
What words could I share to ease<br />
the pain of relearning the world?<br />

Years would pass from then,<br />
slowly becoming who she always was.<br />
Feeling joy in herself<br />
and in her life.<br />

"We should find other partners."<br />
World shattered again.<br />
The deepest hell coming true;<br />
her wife did not want her as she is.<br />

New grief, new pain,<br />
an entire world unraveling<br />
in anguish and tears.<br />
But at least she had learned to cry.<br />

I stand before her,<br />
from all those years ago,<br />
without the pain of experience<br />
to teach her.<br />

What could I say?<br />
She looked up with eager eyes,<br />
unsure who she was even looking at,<br />
awaiting my next words.<br />

I looked down at her,<br />
the child who did not know<br />
what was to come,<br />
and would not understand.<br />

"I love you."<br />
I smiled.<br />
So did she.<br />
What else could I say?<br />
