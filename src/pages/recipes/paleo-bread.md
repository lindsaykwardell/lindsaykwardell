I typically make 3 loaves at a time, because it uses a full can of pumpkin, so the rest of the can doesn’t go to waste.

## Directions

- Preheat the oven to 325.
- In a large bowl, combine dry ingredients, then mix well.
- In a smaller bowl, add wet ingredients, then beat to combine.
- Pour wet ingredients into large ingredients. Mix well. A fork is typically the best option for this, then use a spatula to finish.
- Pour mixed ingredients into bread pans.
- Bake for 45 minutes.
- Remove loaves from bread pans, and place on a cooling rack.
- When cool, enjoy!

## Storage

- Loaves can be stored in the refrigerator for up to 1 week.
- Loaves can also be stored in the freezer.
- The best option is to store in the fridge overnight, then slice and freeze.
- Individual slices can be reheated in the toaster.

## Customization Options
- Almond flour can be replaced 1 for 1 with any nut flour, or 1 for ¾ with garbanzo bean flour.
- Canned pumpkin can be replaced 1 for 1 with canned sweet potato, applesauce, or mashed banana
- Dried, fresh, or frozen fruit can be added to the dry ingredients. The bread may require a longer cooking time.
- Additional spices could include cinnamon/ginger/nutmeg, or rosemary/thyme/sage.
