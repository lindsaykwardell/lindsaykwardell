> Partially. This provides a bit of app scaffolding as well. With elm-live you still need to bring in elm-test, elm-review, etc. 
> 
> Because of the integration with Vite, it also allows for working nicely with other JS bits, such as inlining image assets and importing 3rd party code.

> Going back to the original point, though, I'm torn. I like the legendary rule from a flavor and balancing perspective, but getting uncommon legendary cards feels awkward if we're just going to keep doing it. Maybe just name cards but not make them legendary and see how it feels?
