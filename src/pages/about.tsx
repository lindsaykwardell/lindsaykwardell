        My name is Lindsay Wardell. Welcome to my website. I am a partner,
        parent, writer, and minimalist. My primary work is collectively called
        Ilandrior. It is a fantasy setting, but intended to be relatable at the
        same time as fantastic. While there is plenty of history and lore to dig
        into, my main focus is on a period much like our own world. Large
        empires cover the land, alliances and formed and broken, and political
        intrigue and shuffling rule the day. But it doesn’t forget the smaller
        characters, those who don’t have as great an impact on the world at
        large.

        The first novel in this series, The Folly of Wizards, follows two main
        characters. The first is Lindin, recently promoted to the rank of High
        Mage within the magocratic Argantin Empire. The second, Brayand Hathen,
        governor of the port city of Alden. Other characters will enter and
        leave as needed to tell the story, but the main focus is on these two,
        and their interactions with those around them.

        Every so often, new portions of the novel will be posted here for your
        enjoyment. When the novel is completed, it will be available for
        purchase as either an eBook or a traditional book. Other content will be
        available on other days of the week as it is created. You can follow
        what is going on via Facebook, Twitter, Google+, RSS, or by e-mail.
