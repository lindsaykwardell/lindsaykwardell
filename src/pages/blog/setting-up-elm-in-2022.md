If you haven't used Elm before, it can be a bit intimidating to get started. A pure functional programming language for building web applications, Elm provides a number of tools for writing Elm apps, including `elm reactor` for fast recompiling of specific modules and `elm make` for building JS assets. But this workflow can feel a bit lacking if you're coming from a Javascript ecosystem, where hot module reload (HMR), automatic bundling, and integration with CSS and other frontend technologies is common.

Luckily, there are a number of options for setting up a successful Elm application today. The following are a number of recommendations that you can use to get started with a new Elm codebase. I'll go over ways to get a better development environment, as well as the tooling surrounding Elm that makes working with the language as delightful as possible.
