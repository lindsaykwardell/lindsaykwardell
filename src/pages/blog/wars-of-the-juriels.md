As a learning experience, I have started building a turn-based strategy game based on Ilandrior. Currently I’m calling it Wars of the Juriels. It takes place in the time before the Argantin Empire, in the kingdoms of the Juriels. Currently, two players take turn expanding their kingdom and fighting each other for control of the board.

I started the project as a way to practice using React, a very popular Javascript library. At this point, I’d say the game is playable, but definitely not done.

Here’s the link to the GitHub page for it: https://github.com/lindsaykwardell/wars-of-the-juriels

My plan is to make it a desktop application, and allow for either local network play or online play. As I make major progress I’ll post updates about it.
