## Introduction

Everyone has favorite things in their life. These can be physical things, or music, or places they enjoy being. As developers, we tend to gravitate towards different programming languages, and may even have a favorite language to work with. It may be the one that we're most familiar with, either because it's the first we learned, or because we use it at work and have become accustoned to writing in it. It could also be a language that you've picked up on the side, and hope that one day you can get to use it on some big side project, or (if you let yourself dream) at work.

Whenever I see the question of "What is your favorite programming language?" pop up on Twitter or with coworkers, there is one obvious answer for me: Elm. When I think of an ideal programming language, Elm is the one that comes to mind. For nearly all of my professional career, I have been paid to write JavaScript (typically to build UIs with Vue, or using Node as a server). I feel very comfortable and competent using JavaScript and its related tooling. But if I were given a choice between writing JavaScript and Elm for a given project, I would choose Elm.

This article is not meant to be "X reasons you should be writing Elm." I would like to explore the reasons that I like it, and how it has influenced my thinking when I'm building applications, regardless of the language. Let's take a look at what it is, what there is to like, and why I specifically enjoy using it.

## What is Elm?

According to the Elm official site, Elm is, "[a] delightful language for reliable web applications," but what does that mean? Elm is a functional programming language that compiles to JavaScript. It is specifically designed to be used for building web applications, making it a domain specific language (you aren't able to make CLIs or servers powered by Elm). It is statically typed, and has a very strong type system.
