Where do you turn, when faith grows cold? <br />
When hidden places freeze over, and fill with fear,<br />
And all you knew is but dust and moonlight,<br />
Where do you turn?<br />

When bright fields of golden sun turn to distant memory,<br />
And words of comfort have lost their power,<br />
Where do you turn?<br />

When all the world has turned to night,<br />
And friends of youth are gone,<br />
Summer long since past,<br />
And all that was worth so much is lost,<br />
Where do you turn?<br />

Nowhere.

In the deepest night of winter,<br />
The snow covers the Earth in white,<br />
And the Moon shines upon it.<br />
A new world is born beneath its light,<br />
Filled with dreams to explore.<br />

Where do you turn?<br />
To yourself, at last.
