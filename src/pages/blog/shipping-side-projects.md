It's late at night. Everyone else has gone to bed, but you're up just a bit later. Your fingers are flying across the keys, your brain fighting against exhaustion but flowing with great ideas. In front of you, your laptop's fans hum gently as your side project's local environment runs in the terminal. Constantly switching between your IDE and the browser, you watch as your ideas come to life before you. It's truly a magical moment. Just one more feature, and it'll be ready to ship...

A week or two later, your app is still half finished, but the drive you felt that night has faded. New ideas have started to form in your mind, unrelated to what you were working on previously. You spun up a new Git repo, and you're almost ready to buy a new domain name. It'll fit nicely next to dozen or so others you've already purchased. One day, you'll ship all of them. At least, that's the plan.

Side projects get a lot of attention from developers. It's common to visit someone's website or Github page and find multiple projects on display, all in various stages of completion or function. On Twitter, I regularly see developers talking about their side projects, often lamenting the fact that they have so many and feeling guilting that they aren't being released or finished. It's especially common to joke about the number of domains that we all have purchased but never used. At some point, I think we as developers get depressed and frustrated because of all the things we started with the best of intentions, but haven't completed.

Rather than stress ourselves out about the amount of work waiting for us when we get off work, I think it's useful to put side projects into context: what they are, what they are for, and who benefits from them. 

## The Purpose of Side Projects

There are lots of reasons for starting a new side project. A new framework could have been released that has some new ideas, or you want to try a new language or library. You could be trying out some new techniques, or just want to explore an idea or two that you created. 

## You Are the Stakeholder

## Scoping Side Projects

I have three kinds of projects - maintained, learning, and slow cooker. 

Maintained projects are typically small, and I can make incremental changes/adjustments as the mood strikes me or a need arises. This includes my blog and a handful of OS projects.

Learning projects are super small, and fully intended to be abandoned. Includes messing around with Pokemon API, or trying out some technique/library. I keep them around to be referenced, but typically they get a small number of commits before they reach MVP.

Slow cooker sounds closer to what you're describing, super ambitious and very featureful. Most of them take years to make any progress, typically in bursts as an idea strikes me. For example, been working on a turn-based strategy game since 2018 as a learning project, currently a sort of polished Elm app.

I don't limit myself on slow cooker ideas, but I tend to only work on one at a time because they're all very ambitious and I need to be able to focus on them. I also typically stop once inspiration fades, because the goal is to enjoy the process over making it work 2.0
