I have never been satisfied with Wordpress as my platform of choice for my website. Partially because I am not a Wordpress developer, and partially because I knew I could build something closer to what I wanted using Gatsby. For those interested, Gatsby is a way to build static websites that gives me full control over the deployment of my site. Out of the box, it is faster than Wordpress, and much more developer-friendly.

But I know most of you who read this don't come here for technical, programming topics. I will warn you, though, that there's a good chance I'll be writing about more of those as well. This post, however, is meant to inform that the URLs from past posts will no longer work, and if you navigate the website you may notice it looks a bit different and works a bit better. Please let me know of any bugs or issues that you find, as I'm trying to polish this site as best I can.

Also, I have been very busy recently, which is why there have been fewer posts. I am planning on writing more soon, following the completion of my bachelor's degree. I have one last test, and then I am free from school! Hooray!

Thank you for sticking around, and I hope you have a great rest of your summer.
